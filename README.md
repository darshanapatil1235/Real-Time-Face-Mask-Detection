# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection.
Developed a real-time face mask detection system using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV.
Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify faces wearing a mask or not. 
Achieved accurate detection of face masks in live video streams from webcam inputs. 
Implemented a userï¿½friendly interface to provide real-time feedback on mask-wearing status. 
The system helps promote public health and safety measures by identifying individuals not wearing masks.
This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. 
The system can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not through a live video feed from a webcam.
